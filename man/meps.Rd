\title{Data set on members of the European Parliament}
\format{A data frame with eight variables:
\describe{
\item{\code{id}}{ID number.}
\item{\code{full_name}}{Full name.}
\item{\code{pterm}}{Parliamentary term.}
\item{\code{pg}}{Political group in the EP. See details.}
\item{\code{np}}{National party. See details.}
\item{\code{country}}{Country.}
\item{\code{pg_full}}{Data frame with full info on roles and political
group memberships during a given parliamentary term.}
\item{\code{np_full}}{Data frame with full info on roles and political
group memberships during a given parliamentary term.}
}

Technically, \code{pg} and \code{np} are the political group and national
party the MEP belonged to at the beginning of the parliamentary term. Since
some MEPs switch parties/groups during the term, \code{pg_full} and
\code{np_full} contain data frames with the full details of party
allegiances, roles, and dates.
